# Installation

## Local usage

If you'd like to use Artemis locally, simply clone and spin up a Vue server:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/satvikpendem/Artemis
vue serve
```

The app will be live on `localhost:8080`, which you can navigate to with your browser. The app is fully client side at this time, with the backend integration with Elixir coming soon. These instructions will change at that time.
